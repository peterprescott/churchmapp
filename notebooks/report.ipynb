    "The project was to extract insight from the postcode data contained in the electoral roll (ie. the register of voting members) of Mossley Hill Church, an Anglican parish church in South Liverpool. The significance of being listed on the electoral roll can vary considerably from church to church, but the church's website declares that \"Electoral rolls provide an indication of the real membership and strength of the church... For us it is an act of commitment...\" [@MossleyHillChurch2020a]."

    "Rather, my task here was more a demonstrative exploration of how postcode data might be turned into useful insight. Specifically, I explored three different (though complementary) approaches one could take to the task. First, I considered the *neighbourhood geodemographics* of the represented postcodes; second, I analyzed the travel distance between postcodes and their respective church, in the context of considering *catchment areas*; third, I developed an extendable mobile web app to allow individual interaction with postcode data in the fashion of a *data dashboard*. While I believe this does offer useful wisdom for church leaders seeking to better reach their communities, it is equally relevant to any sphere of activity interested in engaging with people in specific places.

I was encouraged to receive swift and positive responses from St Helens Christian Life Centre [@CLC2020], [@Gateway2020], and the Stoneycroft Salvation Army [@SalvationArmy2020]. In my report here I will include results from all four churches."

    "Geodemographics is often introduced by quoting the pithy definition of @PSleight1997 -- it is called \"the analysis of people by where they live\". The reverse is at least as true: geodemographics is the analysis of places by the people who live there. Specifically, a geodemographic classification is made by algorithmically clustering geoographic areas into similar groups on the basis of the demographic and socioeconomic statistics of their inhabitants, and then naming and describing each resulting group in terms of its shared characteristics. This can be done at whatever scale for which there is data -- generally, it is most useful at the finest possible scale of spatial resolution. The increasing availability of open-source statistics and of analytical computational power means it is now possible to create a geodemographic classification comparitively easily, and to tailor it to the needs of whatever particular case it is intended for; indeed, some have created systems to allow for the automatic real-time creation of geodemographic classifications on the fly [@MAdnan2011]."

    "My aim here was simply to demonstrate the possibilities of geodemographic analysis for the purpose of helping a local church consider the value of their congregation's postcode data. For a simple proof-of-concept it was adequate to make use of an existing classification. Possibilities included commercial classifications such as Mosaic [@Experian2020] and Acorn [@CACI2020]; I chose the 2011 Open Area Classification [@CGaleEtAl2016a]. As its name suggests, it is a free and open-source classification based on data from the 2011 UK census, which classifies each census 'output area' into one of eight 'supergroups': 'Constrained City-Dwellers', 'Cosmopolitans', 'Ethnicity Central', 'Hard-Pressed Living', 'Multicultural Metropolitans', 'Rural Residents', 'Suburbanites' or 'Urbanites'. Each of these titles has a descriptive 'pen portrait' explaining in a few sentences its characteristics, and is subdivided into groups and subgroups with further relevant explanation."

In contrast, the data from the other churches shows that their congregations are more diverse in terms of the neighbourhoods their members live in, with the top two supergroups being much closer in each case."

    "There is then the question of how to respond to this analysis. In retail strategy, geodemographic classification is often used with the assumption that those in similar neighbourhoods to existing customers are likely to themselves become customers. But a church is not a retail business with customers, and there is heated debate around the issue of homogenous-unit churches: are they necessary for church growth [@DMcGavran1990], or deficiently unethical [@LPope1957] -- or can they perhaps be defended on Christian ethical grounds after all [@CWagner1978]."

    "A catchment area is \"the area extent from which the main patrons of a [service] will typically be found\" [@LDolegaEtAl2016]. The concept is widely used in retail, in education [@JPearce2000], and in health [@GFulopEtAl2011]. Although similarly geographical, the idea is quite different to the territorial notion of political constituencies or traditional ecclesiastical parishes where a geographical community is served exclusively by the parliamentary or priestly representative whose zone they inhabit. Rather, to think in terms of 'catchment areas' is to think in terms of an overlapping set of multiple services that both combine and compete in complex and dynamic relationship with the choices of the target community."

To do this it draws data from Open Street Map [@MHaklayWeber2008], a user-generated map that now covers more than 80% of the global road network [@CBarrington-LeighMillard-Ball2017]. First, I used a postcode-coordinate conversion table created by @FreeMapTools2020 from Ordnance Survey, Royal Mail and ONS data, and then I used OSMNx to calculate the shortest distance by road from each postcode to its respective church, and then to visualize those routes on a map (Figure 3 shows that made for Mossley Hill)."
