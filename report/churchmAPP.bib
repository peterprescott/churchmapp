Although dashboards are potentially powerful, this potential is rarely realized. The greatest display technology in the world won't solve this if you fail to use effective visual design. And if a dashboard fails to tell you precisely what you need to know in an instant, you'll never use it, even if it's filled with cute gauges, meters, and traffic lights. Don't let your investment in dashboard technology go to waste.This book will teach you the visual design skills you need to create dashboards that communicate clearly, rapidly, and compellingly. Information Dashboard Design will explain how to:Avoid the thirteen mistakes common to dashboard designProvide viewers with the information they need quickly and clearlyApply what we now know about visual perception to the visual presentation of informationMinimize distractions, cliches, and unnecessary embellishments that create confusionOrganize business information to support meaning and usabilityCreate an aesthetically pleasing viewing experienceMaintain consistency of design to provide accurate interpretationOptimize the power of dashboard technology by pairing it with visual effectivenessStephen Few has over 20 years of experience as an IT innovator, consultant, and educator.
