  abstract = {Fresh Expressions of Church are most significant development in the Church of England in recent decades. Many have called for a thorough theological engagement with the movement. The Church of England is engaging in radical new departures when the ecclesiological thinking for such experiments is far from complete. Parishes are the mainstay of the \&\#39;inherited church\&\#39;. Frequently they are belittled and cast as either unhelpful or irrelevant. The authors argue for the vitality of the parish, both for mission and for discipleship. The authors argue that the forms of the church are to be an embodiment of her faith. They should therefore be more determined by our theological traditions than by the surrounding culture. They show that the traditions of the parish church represent ways in which time, space, community are ordered in relation to God and the gospel.},

Furthermore, this contribution empirically examines whether people in their choice of the established surgeons minimize the ways time (expense minimization) or if they are not aware of the nearest doctor, but the doctor of their confidence (act of preferential expression).},

Urbanization affects all of us, whether we love in cities or not, and this impact will increase in the coming decades.   For fifteen years Urban Expression has been motivating people to get up and move into inter-city neighborhoods to see what they can learn and what difference they can make. This book gets into the heads and hearts of our teams and unpacks the values that have inspired these missionaries to be urban to the core.   Grass-roots honest reflections from some of our one hundred current and former team members and mission partners, capture the essence of what has shaped the thinking and activity of this experimental urban mission agency.  If you are concerned about cities, those on the margins of society, cross-cultural mission or new forms of church, this book will inspire and challenge your core convictions about mission priorities in an urban world.},

  abstract = {School performance tables have been used in the UK with the intention of giving parents an indication as to how well local schools are performing in order that they may make a more informed decision about which school to send their child to. It is likely that the performance measurements are not only a result of the success of the school but also dependent on the background of the children that attend it. School performance tables do not provide information upon the social context in which the school is set. It is, therefore, important to be able to provide information about the social characteristics of a school's catchment area. This is technically difficult because firstly school catchment areas are not strictly defined and secondly census units have no link to catchment geography of a school. This paper offers three techniques that may be suitable for establishing the link between the point information available on the performance of the school and the areal census data. Each technique is tested to see how well this link has been established in each case.},

Old-style system administrators may be disappearing in the face of automation and cloud computing, but operations have become more significant than ever. As this O'Reilly Radar Report explains, we're moving into a more complex arrangement known as "DevOps."Mike Loukides, O'Reilly's VP of Content Strategy, provides an incisive look into this new world of operations, where IT specialists are becoming part of the development team. In an environment with thousands of servers, these specialists now write the code that maintains the infrastructure. Even applications that run in the cloud have to be resilient and fault tolerant, need to be monitored, and must adjust to huge swings in load. That was underscored by Amazon's EBS outage last year.From the discussions at O'Reilly's Velocity Conference, it's evident that many operations specialists are quickly adapting to the DevOps reality. But as a whole, the industry has just scratched the surface. This report tells you why.},

Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} Retail challenges and potential are considered through exploring the attitudes and behaviour of residents in a range of towns, where the key factors affecting trade are identified using regression analysis and then explored further using more open-ended approaches. Findings \textendash{} The resident surveys illustrate a sizeable leakage of retail expenditure out of the towns, particularly for comparison goods. Regression analysis shows that this leakage is more part of a general trend rather than being associated with high levels of migration into the towns. Residents seem to fit into two different groupings: first, those whose expectations can be met at the small town level; and second, those wanting a different offer and tending to go elsewhere. Encouraging trade from the former provides the most realistic policy objective. Practical implications \textendash{} Key issues relate to getting the basics right, providing support to independent/specialist shops, encouraging firms to fill missing key elements of the retail offer and, where population change is occurring, ensuring that the expansion of services does not have detrimental effects for town centres. Originality/value \textendash{} This paper illustrates that although there are many retail challenges-facing small towns, there is potential for them to maintain their viability and vitality.},

  abstract = {When did churches start to appear more empty than full - and why? The very physicality of largely empty churches and chapels in Britain plays a powerful role in popular perceptions of 'religion'. Empty churches are frequently cited in the media as evidence of large scale religious decline. The 'Empty' Church Revisited presents a systematic account of British churchgoing patterns over the last two hundred years, uncovering the factors and the statistics behind the considerable process of decline in church attendence. Dispelling as myth the commonly held views that the process of secularization in British culture has led to the decline in churchgoing and resulted in the predominantly empty churches of today, Gill points to physical factors, economics and issues of social space to shed new light on the origins of empty churches. This thoroughly updated edition of Robin Gill's earlier work, The Myth of the Empty Church, presents new data throughout to explore afresh the paradox of church building activity in a context of decline, the patterns of urbanisation followed by sub-urbanisation affecting churches, changes in patterns of worship, and changes within the sociology of religion in the last decade.},
