# Internship Project

A Data Science Project for Mossley Hill Church, as part of my MSc/PhD at the University of Liverpool's Geographic Data Science Lab.

## The Task
> The student will work on a research project defined between the student and an external organisation.
>
> The aims of the placement will be defined in terms of progressive risks in effecting a solution:
> - The first aim should have a low risk of failure;
> - the second aim will be more challenging but capable of solution given initiative and energy on the part of the student;
> - and the third aim can have a 'blue skies' element, a real research challenge and consequently a high risk of failure but success will demonstrate exceptional competence and initiative.
