# churchmAPP API

This is the backend API server for the churchmAPP project.

You can find the frontend interface [here](https://churchmapp.netlify.com).

Or you might be interested in the source-code [here](https://github.com/peterprescott/churchmapp), which is probably also the best way of working out how the API works.
