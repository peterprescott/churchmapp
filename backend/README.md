# Backend

This was built on the foundation of Max Mautner's excellent [Simple API](https://github.com/), an excellent demonstration of how to struction a Flask API, using Flask-Restful to manage the API resources, and SQLAlchemy to interface with the database.

I have extended it to include password hashing and JSON web token validation -- as well as adapting it to my particular purposes in other ways.

It remains free to use under the MIT License.

The functionality of [the API](../notebooks/api.ipynb), the [password-hashing](../notebooks/hash.ipynb) and the [JWT authentication](../notebooks/auth.ipynb) is demonstrated by their accompanying [notebooks](../notebooks/README.md).
