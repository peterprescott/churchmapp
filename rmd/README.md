# RMarkdown 

These markdown files are synchronized by `jupytext` with their respective `.ipynb` [notebooks](../notebooks/README.md) and `.py` [scripts](../rmd/README.md).

Although the extension is `.Rmd`, the code chunks which they include can be in any language. In my case, the likely candidate is Python.
